    <h1><b><u>HOBBIES</u></b></h1>
    
    <h5>I am an ardent reader.I enjoy reading books and fantasise those occurences in the real world.<br>
        I often believe that it was my situations that led me to books.As a single child it was often<br>
        diffcult for me to be at home alone and the emotions I had to face on a daily basis made me more vulnerable<br>
        I started off with Children's magazine named Balarama.Balarama was a weekly magazine aimed at all the fridays.<br>
        Later I began reading newspapers,fictions and non fictions.Langauges also palys a huge role in my reading journey<br>
        I began reading malaylam and shifted to English as the time passed.

        I am also a dancer ,classical dancer to be more specific.I began the journey of dance at the age of 4 <br>
        Bharatnatyam was my initial dance form before gaining interest in Mohiniyattom.Classical dances are <br>
        always a visual treat but to understand the story conveyed through dance one has to know the regional stories or<br>
        mythologies.Kerala is often known for all the dance forms and music hence called God's own country.Mohiniyattom is<br>
        the state dance of kerala,it focusses mostly on the lasya and shringara bhava of dance.

        <h5>
        More than everything that I disclosed to you in the above paragraphs,I find immense pleasure in travelling<br>
        It doesn't matter whether I am travelling to a long distance destination or a short ,I always enjoy the sceneries <br>
        around me.I also click pictures and record videos while travelling.My first lone trip was with my friends to Mysore.<br>
        It was wonderful as we began the journey early morning by train .We explored all the scenic places nearby and returned <br>
        a day after in the ame train.
